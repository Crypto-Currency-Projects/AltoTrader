# AltoTrader

**Automated trading on the kraken exchange**

## Introduction
This is a trading bot to perform automated trading on the kraken exchange via [Kraken's API](https://www.kraken.com/help/api). The bot requires Python 3 and a module called ``krakenex``. You can simply install it by running:

``pip3 install krakenex``

from your bash. 

The trading strategy is based on the intersection of rolling means with different window width. Which window width is to choose highly depends on the traded asset pairs and the current market situation. Therefore no recommendation on the windows can be given.
